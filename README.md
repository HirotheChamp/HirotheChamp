üëã Hi, My name is Kyle Hiroshi Young. I was born in Los Gatos, California and I'm currently living in Campbell, California.

I enjoy trying new food and I love animals üê∂, nature, music and especially dance!

I bounced around many jobs working as a server and bartender, deciding I wanted to change career paths. Since learning some web development as a child, I decided to further my coding skills by learning full stack development.

I joined a coding bootcamp and I spent 4 months learning web development in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java and MERN.

Now I strive to develop fun, creative and useful websites and web applications. Feel free to check out my github and let me know if you have any questions.
